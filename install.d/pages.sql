This computing network is called ResNet.  <br /></p><p>ResNet users are responsible for all network traffic originating from their computers. This includes, but is not limited to: email, Internet browsing, file transfers, and connections to other machines. </p><p>ResNet users are required to follow all University, Computing &amp; Information Technology (CIT) and University Residence Halls rules and policies.<br /></p><p>As a condition of use, to initially connect to ResNet residents must ensure that their computer(s) present no identifiable risk to the network, i.e. the computer has anti-virus software installed and up-to-date critical operating system updates applied.<br /></p><p>At any time that there is credible evidence that a ResNet attached computer has become a risk to the network, ResNet access will be denied and the resident will be required to re-certify the computer\'s safe operation at his/her expense.<br /></p><p>Additionally, ResNet users must be aware that: </p><ol><li>ResNet must be used in accordance with all Copyright laws. This includes, but is not limited to, refraining from using your computer in a way that would violate those laws such as operating pirated software or MP3 servers. </li><li>URHA communication services, wiring and other hardware may not be modified or tampered with in any way. This includes attempting to extended the network beyond the area of its intended use (for example: Installing a hub or Remote Access Server). </li><li>ResNet must be used in accordance with URHA policies on Business Activity. It can not be used to post advertisements for personal business, or for the sale of products or services for commercial gain. </li><li>Harassment of other users, by any method, will not be tolerated. </li><li>ResNet can not be used to misrepresent or hide your personal identity. (for example: email sent from a fake address, or from any address that is not yours) </li></ol><p>Violating any of these conditions may result in: Suspension or loss of ResNet usage privilege, expulsion from University Residence Halls, discipline from other university bodies such as the Student Judiciary, criminal charges. Damage or theft of ResNet wiring or hardware is the financial responsibility of the residence members. If responsibility is traced to any individual or particular group of individuals, then they will be held personally responsible for the theft or damage. </p><p>ResNet users are also expected to be responsible network citizens. ResNet is a shared resource and as such, users should refrain from using any application which may interfere with the use of the network by others.</p><p>Think of your personal computer as your computing home. It is advisable to &quot;lock the front door&quot; so that people can not use your machine without your supervision. Using a power-on password, or a screen saver password are good ways to control access to both the information on your computer, and your computer\'s access to ResNet.</p></body></html>'),('msg:10024','<html><head></head><body>\r\n<h3>Problem:  BackOrifice  was found</h3>\r\n<h3>Description</h3>\r\n<p>BackOrifice<!-- #BeginLibraryItem \"/Library/is an app.lbi\" -->\r\nis an application that is designed to give unauthorized users full control over your computer.
