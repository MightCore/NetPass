<P><DIV class="fc">N</div>etPass is a vendor-neutral network environment for 
      quarantining clients identified as being out of compliance with your
      network policy.</P>

<P>NetPass currently supports Cisco and Nortel switches. Those switches
	must support VLAN trunking. Specific models approved (tested, known
	to work) for use with
	NetPass are:</P>

<ul>
	<li> Cisco </li>
	<ul>
	      <li> 3500 series (3548XL, 3524XL, 3550-12G, 3550-24EMI) </li>
	      <li> 6500 series </li>
	</ul>
      <li> Nortel </li>
      <ul>
	<li> Late model 350 (equivalent to the 450 without the cascade
	  port). <BR>NetPass will <I>not</I> work with earlier 350s that do not
	  support trunking of VLANs. </li>
	<li> 450 </li>
	<li> 470 </li>
	<li> 5510 </li>
      </uL>
</uL>

      <P>NetPass uses SNMP to control the switches. It should be possible to
	develop an appropriate plugin for any switch that meets the
	following feature requirements:
      </P>

      <dl>
	<dt> SNMP Managable </dt>
	<dd> The switch must be managable via SNMP. For efficiency reasons,
	  SNMPv2, specifically, must be supported. If it is not support by
	  the switch, then processing of the SNMP commands is likely to
	  take too long - resulting in timeouts and delays and use
	  dissatification. </dd>
	<dt> 802.1q VLAN Tagging </dt>
	<dd> The switch must support 802.1q VLAN tagging. In addition, it
	  must permit trunking of VLANs to other switches. For example, the
	  original Nortel 350 switch supported tagging of ports into VLANs,
	  but only internally. The tags could not be propogated (trunked)
	  outside of the switch. For that reason, the original Nortel 350
	  can not be used with NetPass.</dd>
	<dt> MIB-II Linkup/Linkdown Traps</dt>
	<dd> Some of NetPass' functionality depends upon being able to
	  receive notification of client port state changes. </dd>
	<DT> Layer-2 Topology Aware </dT>
	<dd>Nortel calls this <I>Autotopology</I> and Cisco
	  uses <I>CDP</I>. This feature allows the switches to build a map of
	  how they are connected which, in turn, allows NetPass to more efficiently
	  locate the client's port. Note that this feature is typically
	  implemented in a proprietary way - meaning that if you use a mixture of Nortel and
	  Cisco switches, they won't be able to exchange layer-2 topology
	  information. It's possible to deploy NetPass in a mixed vendor
	  environment without significant performance degradation. The
	  actual befit of having the topology information depends upon the
	  architecture of your network.
	</dd>
      </dl>

      <P>
      In addition to the above, the switch should be able to process SNMP
      requests in a timely manner. If the switch takes too long, is
      underpowered, or simply can't handle multiple concurrent SNMP
      queries, then timeouts and delays are likely to occur.
      </P>
      <P>
	As of this
      writing (Nov'04), Nortel 470's when deployed in a hybrid stack (a
      mixture of 470s and 450s) are not capable of responding to the SNMP
      queries rapidly enough. Standalone units and homogenous stacks of
      470s or 450s don't experience this problem.
      </P>
