<h2 class='mainpage'>What Is NetPass?</h2>

<img class="logo" src="img/arrows3.png">

<DIV class="fc">N</div>etPass is a vendor-neutral network environment for 
quarantining clients identified as being out of compliance with your
      network policy.

<h2 style='margin-left: 35%;'>How Does NetPass Work?</H2>

      <P>NetPass works by assigning client ports into one of two VLANs. The default
      is for the port to be in the <i>quarantined</i> VLAN state. In this
      state, all traffic from the client is directed towards the NetPass Validation
      Server. The NPVS intercepts web traffic, performs compliance checks, 
      facilitates self-remediation and moves the client's port to the
	<I>unquarantined</I> state once compliance is assured. </P>

      <P><I>Self-remediation</I> is achieved by correlating specific
	compliance failures with documentation on how to bring the client
	computer into compliance. Once the steps are followed, compliance
	is re-checked.</P>


<H2 class='mainpage'>Identify</H2>

<img style="float: left;" src="img/eye.png">


	<P> NetPass is built to offer modular identification. Any part of your existing
	infrastructure can be used to trigger a quarantining of a
	client. For example, your mailserver might detect a particular
	client sending out virus laden email - a sure sign that the client
	is infected. That very same mailserver can instruct the NPVS to
	quarantine the client. As part of that transaction, the mailserver
	would tell the NPVS why the client is being quarantined. This
	information would be used to assist the client in the
	self-remediation process. </P>

      <P>NetPass includes compliance checking modules for <a
	  href="http://www.snort.org">Snort</a> and <a
	  href="http://www.nessus.org">Nessus</a>
	in addition to an API for integrating other indentification
	systems. NetPass also includes a web interface for administrative
	purposes - allowing you to manually quarantine hosts when necessary.
	</P>

      <P>
	NetPass pays attention to the state of the switch port and the
	devices attached to each port. If a quarantined client moves to
	another switch port, they will remain quarantined. If a quarantined
	client plugs into a mini-switch that contains unquarantined clients
	the port that the mini-switch is plugged into will be
	quarantined. NetPass supports <a href="supequip.html">multiple
	  switch vendors</a> out of the box and is modular, allowing for
	additional future support of other vendors.
      </P>
      <P>
	NetPass is designed to be flexible and offers several 
	<a href="deploy.html">deployment options</a> - allowing you to decide how
	stringent you want to be in identifying when to quarantine a port.
      </P>

<h2 class='mainpage'>Quarantine</h2>

<img style="float: right;" src="img/quar.png">


<P>
	Once a client is identified as being out of compliance, it is
	quarantined. This is accomplished by changing the VLAN membership
	of the switch port that	the client is connected to. NetPass
	provides a per-subnet quarantine, rather than one big
	quarantine. This allows you to segment your quarantine as it is not
	appropriate to place all machines in the same quarantine, even
	temporarily, as some other network access control systems do.
</P>
<P>
	While in the quarantine, the client keeps their "normal" IP
	address. They are not given a new distinct IP address. NetPass does
	not rely on DHCP to work.
</P>

<h2 class='mainpage'>Remediate</h2>

<img style="float: left;" src="img/rem.png">


<P>
	In addition, the client uses your normal
	DNS servers, no custom DNS servers are needed and no fake DNS
	records are used. The client retains web access to approved
	websites (that you control) for the purposes of downloading
	patches, virus definition files and utilities to help the client
	self-remediate. This helps, in many instances, reduce the amount of
	IT staff time required to fix a client. When deploying NetPass at a
	University, this allows students living on-campus to correct the
	problem and get out of quarantine as rapidly as possible.
</P>
<P>
	Once the client has completed all of the remediation instructions
	that they are given, NetPass once again checks them for compliance.
	If any additional steps are required, or the client did not
	successfully follow one or more of the instructions, they are
	presented with more instructions and left in the quarantine. This
	process continues until the client is in compliance.
</P>
<P>
	NetPass is built for flexibility, allowing the NetPass Administrator to
	override a client's state and force an unquarantining if
	necessary. A client can be permenantly quarantined or unquarantined.
	In the former case, the client can not get unquarantined without
	administrator intervention. In the latter case, the client can not
	be quarantined by automated processes (such as the mailserver in
	the above example).
</P>
