when a user pulls up a web browser, they are redirected to our webserver

store the original URL they are trying to get to

determine if they are already registered

if they are, determine what port they are on and unquarantine it

if the are not already registered or are manually quarantined, 
look up their results-set and display the results

if the results-set is zero and they are not-manually quarantined, 
then register them and unquarantine them

if they are manually-quarantined, then basically the results-set 
can never be zero until someone manually removes the members of
the results-set that have been manually inserted. the end-user
cant remove them thru self-remediation.
