Netpass End-user Phases 
-----------------------

LOGIN         - The end-user is shown the welcome page and is instructed to login.

SCAN          - The end-user has passed the login phase, and is being scanned by netpass.

REMEDIATE     - An end-user is put into the remediate stage for the following reasons:

		* They have failed the scan and have one or more vulnerabilities.
		* They have been quarantined for another reason. In this case, there
		  will be a detailed message waiting for them.


COMPLETE      - An end-user is allowed to enter the COMPLETE phase if they have passed the
	   	scan. The machine is registered and they are checked for compliance with 
		our MULTIPLE MACHINES ON ONE PORT policy. 

		If another machine is found on their port that has not been through 
		Netpass successfully, the current machine will be quarantined and
		sent back to the REMEDIATE phase. At the REMEDIATE stage. they will be 
		displayed a message about our policy.

		*Note* - During the testing of Netpass, a survey will be displayed at this
		         phase once for all users. Users cannot pass this phase without
			 filling out the survey.

                A Permanently Unquarantined machine has been set that way manually through the admin tool.


Netpass Troubleshooting Guide
=========================================


Netpass Client Requirements
---------------------------

1. A web browser that adheres to W3C web standards.
2. The web browser must accept cookies from the buffalo.edu domain.



Netpass Reset ("ALT-CTRL-DELETE")
---------------------------------

Use these steps if you are having severe issues with a client,
such as being stuck at one phase for an unknown reason.

1. Make sure that the client matches the above requirements.

2. Take a screenshot. Log the OS version, browser version, etc.
   If the problem cannot be resolved or you see unexpected output,
   mail this information to the netpass mailing list so that we
   can fix any bugs with the best possible information.

3. Erase all buffalo.edu cookies from the browser. Restart the
   browser.

4. Re-visit Netpass and try to walk through the steps again.

5. Check the Quarantine Control and make sure the machine hasn't
   been quarantined for disciplinary reasons.

6. Check the Audit logs and see if anything useful is being
   logged for the client.

7. If all else fails, contact the Netpass team for
   troubleshooting help.
