	jcm bug#1410167 results in audit page didnt sort correctly and included
		duplicates.

		$mac address will jump to the manual registration screen.
	jcm fixed table header in mr.mhtml which said "Search" even tho that 
		didn't make sense.
	jcm feature: BeginScan now obeys the "What to do when Nessus is down?"
		setting (Config->General). If you set When_Down to "FAIL" then
		you need to also create a page called "msg:nessus_down" which
		will be displayed so that the user knows why they can't get
		out of quarantine.
